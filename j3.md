1) Polymorphism is a situation where a variable declared at compile time but can dynamically change during runtime
2) The concept of polymorphism allows for the toString() method to be run at the end for 1 of 4 things because the program allows for the assignment of the 'type' of the variable at runtime, as in, dynamically bound. If it was not dynamically bound than it would always print out the object toString.
3) Prints out "A"
4) Prints "~~~B~~~" then prints out "~~~B~~~" again
5) Prints out "A" then "A" again
6) This should not compile because of the private operator
7) Prints out "A: 1"
8) "foo1: B B"
9) Name: Fluffy
    Species: Canis Familaris (pomeranian)
   Name : George

10) Here is what it prints
42
50
A does not have a baz, so it will not compile

41
49
y

42
7
D wont compile because D and A do not have baz methods

11) An abstract class, can never have its constructor called directly, only its super, you would use it to organize classes
12) Tires, wheels in the abstract
